About this. Text Converter

This tool allows you to convert regular text into "zlg" glitched text by adding diacritical marks to simulate a digital glitch. You can choose different levels of glitch intensity, with higher levels producing more complex effects. Additionally, the app provides a feature to reverse the "zlg" effect, turning the glitched text back into standard text.

Key Features:

Convert standard text to zlg glitching with six intensity levels.
Reverse the glitching and return the text to its original state.
Copy the output text to your clipboard with a single click.
